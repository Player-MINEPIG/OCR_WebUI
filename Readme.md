# OCR WebUI

## Intro

This is a project used to take texts out of files that cannot directly select the texts. It has command-line version, but I'll recommend the webui version. The following texts without special explanation are all refer to the webui version.

As for the AIPC is developing fast, soon the only superiority of this project which is privacy will disappear. So this is just a project for study purpose. If you wish to use it, I appreciate it, but still appeal you to find some more mature projects.

### File Upload

This is where you upload your files.
Click or drop file(s) there to upload.
Once the upload starts, the file name with a time stamp will be shown there, no matter it uploads successfully or not.
Once the upload succeeds, the file will be temporarily saved in the uploads folder.

This is where you can know how the file is being processed.

There are n status listed below

  The original file is converting to the text file.

- Fail to upload

  The file upload is failed. This can be caused by some reason listed below.

  - File type is not supported. (Only support `pdf, jpg, jpeg, png` now)
  - If you are setting up this project on a server, bad network can also be a reason.

- Fail to convert

  The file conversion is failed. This can be caused by some reason listed below.

### Start Converting

A button used to start converting process.

When the converted file exist, it will not process again. i.e. If you really want it to process again, you need to upload the file again or manually delete the output file in the output folder. 

Changing the output file type will let it process again.

### Output File Type

A checkbox used to select the output file type.

Support `md, txt, xml, json, csv, html` now. If you wish to add more types, you can edit the `settings.json` file manually. But the result is not assured.

### File Download

Once the conversion succeeds, a temporary file will be saved in the output folder. And a link to it will be generated.
