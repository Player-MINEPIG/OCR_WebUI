How to Submit

You must complete all three steps!

Step 1 of 3

Create a short video (that’s no more than 3 minutes in Length) in which you present your project to the world. Your video must begin with an opening section that displays:

® your project's title;

® your name;

® your GitHub and edX usernames;
® your city and country;

@ and, the date you have recorded this video.

It should then go on to demonstrate your project in action, as with slides, screenshots, voiceover, and/or live action. See howtogeek.com/205742/how-to-record-your-windows-
mac-linux-android-or-ios-screen for tips on how to make a “screencast,” though you're welcome to use an actual camera. Upload your video to YouTube (or, if blocked in your
country, a similar site) and take note of its URL; it’s fine to flag it as “unlisted,” but don’t flag it as “private.”
